SELECT *

-- First create a staging table to work in and clean the data. We want a table with the raw data in case anything happens

-- Steps
-- 1. Remove Duplicates
-- 2. Standardize the Data
-- 3. Null or Blank Values
-- 4. Remove Necessary Columns/Rows


-- 1. Remove Duplicates

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging;

SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off, `date`, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`) AS row_num
FROM layoffs_staging;

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`) AS row_num
FROM layoffs_staging

SELECT *
FROM duplicate_cte
WHERE row_num >1;


-- Look at oda to confirm

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging
WHERE company = 'Oda';


-- All appear to be legitimate entries and shouldn’t be deleted, look into every row to confirm actual duplicates

SELECT *
FROM (
SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
) AS row_num
FROM layoffs_staging;

SELECT *
FROM duplicate_cte
WHERE row_num >1;


--Some of these contain duplicates. We should delete any containing row >1

WITH DELETE_CTE AS (
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
) AS row_num
FROM layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE row_num >1
) 
DELETE
FROM DELETE_CTE;

WITH DELETE_CTE AS (
SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions) 
AS row_num
FROM layoffs_staging
)
DELETE FROM layoffs_staging
WHERE (company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions, row_num) IN
SELECT (company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions, row_num
FROM DELETE_CTE
AND row_num >1;


--Solution: create new column and add row numbers in, that way we can easily identify rows over 2 and discard

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging ADD row_num INT;

SELECT * 
FROM layoffs_staging
WHERE row_num > 1;

CREATE TABLE `layoffs_staging2` (
  `company` text,
  `location` text,
  `industry` text,
  `total_laid_off` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `percentage_laid_off` text,
  `date` text,
  `stage` text,
  `country` text,
  `funds_raised_millions` int DEFAULT NULL,
  `row_num` INT
  );

INSERT INTO layoffs_staging2 (
`company`, 
`location`,
`industry`,
`total_laid_off`,
`percentage_laid_off`,
`date`,
`stage`,
`country`,
`funds_raised_millions`,
`row_num`)
SELECT `company`, 
`location`,

`funds_raised_millions`,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions) 
AS row_num
FROM layoffs_staging;


--Delete rows showing >1

DELETE FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE row_num > 1;

SELECT * 
FROM layoffs_staging2;


-- 2. Standardize the Data

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2;


-- Industry contains null and empty rows

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL
OR industry = ' '
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE company = 'Airbnb';


-- It looks like Airbnb is Travel but has yet to populate under industry

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Travel'
WHERE company = 'Airbnb';


-- Crypto also has multiple variations

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry LIKE 'Crypto%';

SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;


-- Everything looks good, except few United States locations contain '.' at the end

SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country);

SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;


-- Fix date columns

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2;

-- Use str to date to update this field

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');


-- Convert data type

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;


SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2;


-- 3. Null or Blank Values

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

-- Null values in total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and funds_raised_millions look normal, no need to change
-- Will make calculations easier during EDA phase


-- 4. Remove Necessary Columns/Rows

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;


-- Delete data we cannot use

DELETE FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;


SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2;
